            <h2>What Dance Means to Me</h2>
            <p>For me, dance is not just an activity—it's a journey of self-discovery and connection. As someone who
                practices Latino dances—salsa, bachata, and kizomba, dance represents freedom, sport, and a deep
                connection with myself. It's about embracing the joy of movement, even if I don't know all the steps.
                Mistakes are just part of the process. Through dance, I learn that it's okay to not be perfect and that
                every moment on the dance floor is an opportunity for growth.</p>

            <p>Dance allows me to feel free, express emotions, and communicate more deeply with others. It's a
                continuous
                journey of personal exploration that helps me connect with myself and embrace self-love along the way.

            <h2>What Dance Means to Others</h2>
            <p>When I asked others what dance means to them, I received diverse and beautiful responses that capture the
                universal and personal significance of dance:</p>

            <p>"Dance is a way to express what I can't say with words." </p>
            <p>"It helps me connect with the music and forget everything around me." </p>
            <p>"For me, dance is fun. It's about moving and feeling free." </p>
            <p>"Dance reminds me to enjoy life and appreciate the present moment." </p>
            <p>"It's more than just movement; it's about connecting with others." </p>
